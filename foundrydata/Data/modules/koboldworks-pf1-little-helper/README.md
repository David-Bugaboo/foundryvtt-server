Bunch of little tweaks, notifications, opinionated improvements, etc. that are too small to exist on their own.

WARNING: Due to limited information available in PF1e system, some of this module's functionality is limited to English due to string matching.  
 PF1 0.78.14 or newer mitigates this problem greatly.

## Features

See [Feature Listing](./FEATURES.md) for listing of features and screenshots of them.

## API

See [API documentation](./API.md).

## Install

Manifest URL: <https://gitlab.com/koboldworks/pf1/little-helper/-/releases/permalink/latest/downloads/module.json>

**WARNING**: Above manifest gives you the repository master branch, not a proper versioned release.  
Currently the version is being incremented irregularly, so if you want to update the module, you need to do so manually by re-installing it.  
The version number currently includes date of the release (local to me) in format of YYYYMMDDHH.

**UPDATING**: You may need to do so manually by re-installing it. Update checks within Foundry will not work usually due to version number not being updated consistently.

## Attribution

If you use any of the code in this project, I would appreciate I or the project was credited for inspiration or whatever where appropriate. Or just drop a line about using my code. I do not mind not having this, but it's just nice knowing something has come out of my efforts.
